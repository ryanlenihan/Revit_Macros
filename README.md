# Revit_Macros
Macros that I've created for various tasks that you might find useful, or you might not.

### Getting Started

To use these macros, you'll need to have macros enabled in your version of Revit. Follow the instructions on the [Autodesk website](https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2025/ENU/?guid=GUID-23497666-2918-4F91-A50A-402949070658) to enable macros.

Next, create a new macro module and a new C# macro in Revit. You can find instructions for this process in the [Autodesk documentation](https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2025/ENU/?guid=GUID-D3A09447-BA7F-4045-88BF-EA8B37F0D46D) for Revit 2025, or [here](https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-D3A09447-BA7F-4045-88BF-EA8B37F0D46D) for Revit 2024 and earlier.

For general guidance on creating macros in Revit, check out this [tutorial](https://www.archdaily.com/797619/how-to-write-your-first-revit-macro-in-7-easy-steps). I'm not associated with these guys, they're just high up on the search rankings. 

### Running the Macros

Once you've compiled the macro, you can run it through the Macro Manager.
